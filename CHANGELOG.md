## INIT-018 — Branch Protection (EPIC-002 policy + EPIC-003 API enforcement)

### Added

- **Branch-protection policy evaluated on every Spine API write.** Every
  ref-advancing call in `internal/artifact` (Artifact Service
  `Create`/`Update`) and `internal/engine` (Orchestrator
  `MergeRunBranch`) consults `branchprotect.Policy.Evaluate`. Governed
  merges are allowed unconditionally; direct writes to a branch covered
  by `no-direct-write` are rejected with a `forbidden` error.
- **`/.spine/branch-protection.yaml`** is seeded by `spine init-repo`
  with the documented defaults (`main: [no-delete, no-direct-write]`).
  Repositories without the file still evaluate against the same
  bootstrap defaults — protection is correct pre-seed.
- **`write_context.override: true`** on **artifact endpoints** opts into the
  per-operation branch-protection override (ADR-009 §4). Only actors
  with `operator+` role effectively use it; contributors see a distinct
  `override_not_authorised` reason. Every honored override emits a
  `branch_protection.override` governance event and adds a
  `Branch-Protection-Override: true` commit trailer. Unnecessary overrides
  (flag set on an unmatched branch) are silent. The equivalent Git push
  path override (`git push -o spine.override=true`) is planned for
  EPIC-004 — the Git endpoint is read-only in this release.
- **`branch_protection.override`** governance event delivered through
  the standard subscription / SSE / event_log path.

### Changed

- `architecture/git-integration.md` §6.4 no longer says "manual merges
  are not allowed" — it now points at ADR-009's enforced policy.
- `architecture/security-model.md` §7.3 rewritten. Previously described
  branch protection as a Git-hosting-level concern; now documents
  Spine's own enforcement surface, the two rule kinds, the bootstrap
  defaults, and the override mechanism.

### Not yet implemented (follow-up)

- Workflow endpoints (`workflow.create`, `workflow.update`) reject
  `write_context.override: true` with `400` today — `workflow.Service`
  does not consult `branchprotect.Policy` yet. Operators writing
  directly to a workflow definition use the ADR-008 operator-bypass
  path instead (omit `write_context` as `operator+` role — adds a
  `Workflow-Bypass` trailer). Unifying the two bypass mechanisms is
  tracked in the TASK-003 scope-decision note.
- Git push path enforcement (EPIC-004) — the pre-receive handler is the
  subject of a follow-up epic.

### Upgrade notes

Clients sending `write_context` to artifact endpoints may now include an
optional `override: boolean`. Omitting it is equivalent to `false`.
Clients sending the field from a non-operator role will see their
request rejected with `override_not_authorised` — previously any
direct write that should have hit a rule was a silent success (the
policy was not wired).
